        <p style="margin-top:45px;"> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreter or JIT-compiled programming language that supports first-class functions . It is most famous as a scripting language for web pages, but it is also used in many non-browser environments such as Node.js , Apache CouchDB , and Adobe Acrobat . JavaScript is a prototype-based dynamic multi-paradigm scripting language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (functional programming, etc.) styles. For more information, see About JavaScript .

            This document covers only the JavaScript language itself, not web pages or other usage environments. If you want to know about a specific API of a web page, please refer to Web API and DOM .
            
            The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript . As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International released the sixth major version of ECMAScript, officially referred to as ECMAScript 2015 (commonly referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6). Since then, the ECMAScript standard has a one-year release cycle. This document is based on the latest draft (currently ECMAScript 2020 ).
            
            JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language . Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are registered trademarks of Oracle in the United States and other countries. However, the two languages ​​have completely different grammar systems and methods of use.
